      <p id="2_Point_Header">
        India and Netherlands will be taking on each other in the twenty-third
        game of the ICC Mens T20I rankings at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Both
        the teams have played one game each in the Super 12 stage so far. India
        is coming off a nail-biting win against their arch-rivals Pakistan in
        the first game. Virat Kohlis unbeaten 82 helped India get across the
        line. In the bowling department, Arshdeep Singh and Hardik Pandya hunted
        3 wickets each. They are currently placed second on the Group 2 points
        table.On the other hand, the Netherlands gave a tough fight to
        Bangladesh and lost by a mere margin of 9 runs. Paul van Meekeren and
        Bas de Leede picked a couple of wickets each while Colin Ackermann
        scored a fighting 62 with the bat. They are positioned last on the Group
        2 points table. These two sides have played a total of 2 head-to-head
        games in this format so far, where India won both games. Despite India
        starting as favorites, a good contest is anticipated here between these
        two sides on Thursday.

        The Sydney Cricket Ground surface often gives batters a reasonable
        chance to score some quick runs. The pitch does not have much assistance
        for the pacers early on, but the spinners may fancy their chances during
        the middle overs here. Chasing would be an ideal option for winning the
        toss at this surface.

        Virat Kohli is a right-handed batsman from India. He hammered 82 runs in
        the last game and will be among the top fantasy picks for this match
        once again. Arshdeep Singh is a left-handed batsman and left-arm medium
        fast bowler from India. He picked up 3 wickets in the last match and the
        team will expect him to deliver upfront with the ball here as well. Bas
        de Leede is a right-handed batsman and right-arm medium pacer from the
        Netherlands. He has marked 58 runs and picked up 9 wickets in this
        tournament so far. He has the potential to win games single-handedly.

        bowler from the Netherlands. He has scored 24 runs and grabbed 5 wickets
        in this tournament so far. He will be hoping to net crucial scalps once
